Understand the system
--------------------------------

- Read :ref:`'What is ONIX?' <what_is_onix>` for a high-level introduction to this hardware and how it differs from classic neuroscience acquisition systems.
- Our :ref:`faq` contains answers to general questions about the system.
- See the :ref:`hardware_guide` for a description of ONIX hardware components and decide which you will need.
- Read :ref:`connection_overview` to see how the hardware devices are connected.

Hardware
--------------------------------

- Get the hardware: At the very least, you will need the PCIe host board, an acquisition computer, and an ONI-compliant device (such as a headstage or Miniscope). Make sure you also acquire the relevant :ref:`cables and tethers <connection_overview>`.
- Install the PCIe host board and get the computer ready using the :ref:`pcie_host_setup_windows`.
- See :ref:`system_setup` for how to set up the rest of the hardware.

Software
--------------------------------

* ONIX uses Bonsai for data acquisition. See the :ref:`bonsai_gettingstarted` page to learn how to install Bonsai and use it to acquire from ONIX.
